"One of the main methods for assessing vocabulary is the use of tests based "
"on the Modern Theory of Testing (Item Response Theory, IRT). These methods "
"allow for the consideration of not only the number of known words but also "
"their complexity. The Rasch Model and its variations (e.g., 1PL, 2PL, 3PL) "
"are widely used for assessing vocabulary."

"In the Rasch Model (1PL), the probability of correctly answering a word "

"An important tool for assessing vocabulary is frequency dictionaries. A "
"frequency dictionary contains information about the frequency of words in a "
"text corpus. Based on the assumption that more frequently occurring words "
"are easier for most native speakers, frequency dictionaries allow for the "
"assessment of word difficulty and use this information in test construction "
"and vocabulary analysis."

"Word difficulty can be determined using its frequency of occurrence. The "
"frequency of occurrence \\( Freq(ipm) \\) can be inversely proportional to "
"its difficulty \\( b_i \\), as represented by the following formula:"
msgstr ""

#: polls/templates/polls/about.html:25
msgid ""
"However, potential inaccuracies in vocabulary assessment should be "
"considered. For example, some words may have a high frequency due to "
"specific usage contexts, which may not always reflect their overall "
"difficulty. It is also important to consider that test-takers' abilities can "
"affect test results, and individual ability differences should be taken into "
"account when interpreting results."
