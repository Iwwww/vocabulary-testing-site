  <p>{% trans 'One of the main methods for assessing vocabulary is the use of tests based on the Modern Theory of Testing (Item Response Theory, IRT). These methods allow for the consideration of not only the number of known words but also their complexity. The Rasch Model and its variations (e.g., 1PL, 2PL, 3PL) are widely used for assessing vocabulary.' %}</p>
  <p>{% trans "In the Rasch Model (1PL), the probability of correctly answering a word depends on the test-taker's ability level and the word's difficulty, represented by the parameter" %} \( b_i \):</p>

  <p>{% trans 'An important tool for assessing vocabulary is frequency dictionaries. A frequency dictionary contains information about the frequency of words in a text corpus. Based on the assumption that more frequently occurring words are easier for most native speakers, frequency dictionaries allow for the assessment of word difficulty and use this information in test construction and vocabulary analysis.' %}</p>

  <p>{% trans 'Word difficulty can be determined using its frequency of occurrence. The frequency of occurrence \( Freq(ipm) \) can be inversely proportional to its difficulty \( b_i \), as represented by the following formula:' %}</p>
  <p>\[ b_i = -\log(Freq(ipm)_i) \]</p>
  <p>{% trans "However, potential inaccuracies in vocabulary assessment should be considered. For example, some words may have a high frequency due to specific usage contexts, which may not always reflect their overall difficulty. It is also important to consider that test-takers' abilities can affect test results, and individual ability differences should be taken into account when interpreting results." %}</p>
